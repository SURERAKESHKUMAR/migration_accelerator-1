Code

The platform consists of four core components:

### 1. Web Interface (Program.cs & Controllers)
ASP.NET Core MVC application serving as the primary user interface for configuration management, testing, and migration orchestration. Built on .NET 8.0 with modern web standards.

### 2. Service Layer (Services Directory)
Business logic implementation for GitHub integration, AWS Secrets management, Terraform execution, and security scanning using established design patterns.

### 3. Data Persistence (Data Directory & Models)
Entity Framework Core integration with SQL Server for storing migration configurations, audit logs, and system state across environment lifecycles.

### 4. Background Scheduler (TerraformBackgroundService)
Asynchronous processing engine for long-running Terraform executions and automated configuration synchronization across environments.

## Technical Requirements

## Installation

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SURERAKESHKUMAR/migration_accelerator-1.git
cd migration_accelerator-1
2. Install Dependencies
bash
dotnet restore
3. Database Configuration
Database credentials are configured in appsettings.json. Update connection parameters for your environment:

JSON
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=migration_accelerator;User Id=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
  },
  "AWS": {
    "Region": "us-east-1",
    "SecretName": "your-secret-name"
  }
}
4. AWS Secrets Manager Setup
The application uses AWS Secrets Manager for credential management. Configure your secret:

bash
# Set AWS credentials
aws configure

# Create/Update secret in Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name migration_accelerator/secrets \
  --secret-string '{"DbPassword":"your-password","ApiKey":"your-key"}'
5. Initialize Database
The application automatically creates required tables on first run via Entity Framework Core migrations:

bash
dotnet ef database update
6. Build Application
bash
dotnet build
Usage
Starting the Application
Launch Web Interface:

bash
dotnet run
Access at: https://localhost:5001

Configure Logging: Review appsettings.json for logging configuration:

JSON
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
Core Workflow

Review detected vulnerabilities and exposed credentials
Remediate security issues before deployment
Validate clean scan status
3. Infrastructure Planning
Create Terraform configurations for target environment
Define resource requirements and specifications
Configure environment-specific variables
Review infrastructure diagrams and dependencies
4. Execution & Deployment
Execute Terraform plan for infrastructure preview
Apply Terraform configurations for actual provisioning
Monitor execution logs and status in real-time
Rollback if deployment issues detected
5. Post-Migration Validation

Best Practices
Naming Conventions
Use descriptive, action-oriented names (e.g., "Migrate Customer Database", "Deploy API Gateway")
Include environment identifier in migration profile names
Follow Team/Project/Environment naming pattern
Document purpose and migration dependencies in description field
Security Guidelines
Credential Management: Never hardcode credentials; use AWS Secrets Manager exclusively
Secret Scanning: Always run Gitleaks scanning before production deployments
Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive operations
Audit Logging: Enable comprehensive audit trails for compliance tracking
Network Security: Use VPC and security groups to restrict access
Migration Planning
Validate all configurations in non-production environments first
Maintain rollback procedures for each migration stage
Document dependencies between infrastructure components
Test disaster recovery and failover scenarios
Implement gradual rollout strategy (canary deployments)
Maintenance & Monitoring
Run background scheduler continuously to maintain configuration freshness
Monitor execution logs for API failures and issues
Periodically review and update obsolete migration profiles
Document all migration decisions and architecture choices
Conduct post-migration reviews and lessons learned sessions
Organization & Governance
Leverage LOB field to group related migrations
Use environment field to segregate profiles by deployment stage
Maintain consistent naming conventions across all teams
Implement change management procedures for production migrations
Establish Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for migration timelines
Troubleshooting
Database Connection Issues
Symptoms: Cannot connect to SQL Server database

Resolution Steps:

Verify SQL Server is running and accessible: sqlcmd -S SERVER -U USER -P PASSWORD
Check connection string in appsettings.json for typos
Ensure database user has appropriate permissions: GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON DATABASE::migration_accelerator TO [USER]
Confirm firewall rules allow database port access (typically 1433)
Review Entity Framework logs: Enable-Migrations -Verbose
AWS Secrets Manager Issues
Symptoms: Failed to retrieve secrets from AWS

Resolution Steps:

Verify AWS credentials are configured: aws sts get-caller-identity
Check IAM permissions for Secrets Manager: aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id your-secret
Confirm secret name matches configuration in appsettings.json
Verify region is correct and secret exists in that region
Check AWS CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
Terraform Execution Failures
Symptoms: Infrastructure provisioning fails or hangs

Resolution Steps:

Verify Terraform CLI is installed: terraform --version
Check Terraform files in /terraform directory for syntax errors: terraform validate
Confirm AWS credentials and permissions for required resources
Review Terraform state file for conflicts: terraform state list
Check application logs for execution errors and stack traces
Test Terraform manually: terraform plan -out=tfplan
GitHub Integration Issues
Symptoms: Cannot connect to GitHub repositories

Resolution Steps:

Verify GitHub Personal Access Token is valid and has required scopes
Test GitHub connectivity: curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
Confirm repository is accessible with provided credentials
Check network connectivity and firewall rules
Review GitHub API rate limits: curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/rate_limit
Performance Issues
Symptoms: Slow page loads or timeouts during migration execution

Resolution Steps:

Check database query performance: Enable SQL Server query analyzer
Monitor background service execution time in logs
Increase timeout settings for long-running Terraform operations
Scale database resources if under heavy load
Review application memory usage and adjust if needed
Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed configurations
Stale Configuration Data
Symptoms: Infrastructure state doesn't match actual resources

Resolution Steps:

Verify background scheduler is running
Check last update timestamp in dashboard
Manually trigger configuration refresh
Confirm source APIs/repositories are accessible
Review scheduler logs for synchronization errors
Run terraform refresh to sync state with actual infrastructure
